      <description>Developer An API &amp;amp; facial recognition system for Woodberry&amp;rsquo;s student that automatically tags relevant individuals in the school photo album instead of manual student tagging.
Nobody likes manual labor This project originally started as a set piece for a production of George Orwell&amp;rsquo;s 1984 and quickly evolved into a face recognition system that automatically tagged various students in the school photo album.
Before such system, the school would take volunteer workers to manually sift through hundreds of images to tag people.</description>

      <description>Developer A computer vision system &amp;amp; web frontend that utilizes fast object detection algorithms on single-board computers and time series forecasting to predict &amp;amp; display wait times at the school grill
Motivation The Fir Tree is a school grill and is oftentimes very crowded and lines regularly reach the exit doors. To alleviate long lines and pressure from workers, I created Fir Tree Stats, a live-updating dashboard that tells you exactly how many people are waiting in the line currently, how long it will take for you to get your food, and how many people were inside the restaurant.</description>
