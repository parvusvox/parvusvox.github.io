### Co-Founder

A privacy & anonymity centric forum for open discussion for Woodberry Forest School

## Motivation
Woodberry is a private all-boys boarding school in the south. In an environment like that, getting your voice heard can be a challenging task. You barely have to go through the first few paragraphs of Woodberry's wikipedia entry to get the sense of strict hierarchical structures of the prefect system.

In such environments, the voices of marginalized identities, views, and opinions are oppressed and dismissed purely by association to the individual who authors them. The solution was to create a social media platform where all voices, no matter their rank in the system, are heard.

## Usage & Adoption
The site quickly caught on with the entire school population. By the third week we got 40,000 visits per day from a student population of 400. While unique users are impossible to track due to a complete anonymity policy, almost every single student had been on the site at least once
