A colonization game that (semi) accurately simulates thermodynamic and physical properties of exo-planets and star systems.\nhttps://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/planets-near-and-far/build-planet-workshop/teams/quinn-the-buffalo/project\nStupid planets aims to recreate a sandbox-like environment of procedural star systems and exoplanets. The aim of Stupid Planets is to provide an educational experience on the basic elements needed for life and colonization on exoplanets through scientific modelling, physically based orbital movement and loose modelling of chemical compositions and interactions.\nThe focal point of the game play mechanic revolves around the mad and intricate balance of several different factors including the chemical composition of planets, temperature, its orbital radius, and its mass. Players have the ability to colonize planets and get real time feedback on why their colonization efforts failed/succeed or they can wait for life to randomly develop on planets. However, players need to be aware that changing one variable could lead to an unforeseen reaction of circumstance that may ruin the planet entirely.\nWe calculated the temperatures of the planets via multiple factors involving the sun\u0026rsquo;s mass, the planets\u0026rsquo; distances to the sun, as well as their chemical makeup and terrain. By altering these elements, the player is able to create a potentially habitable planet. The calculations were taken from a number of online sources, and changed to suit our purposes. Some values that are essential to our calculations such as the albedo values of these simulated planets cannot be calculated so we approximated it based on known planets and their characteristics.\nWe implemented another method for temperature. We analyzed the thermal conditions at a planet\u0026rsquo;s surface. The power on the surface per area is related to a multitude of factors, including the temperature and the radius of the star, the distance between the star and the planet, and the percentage of energy actually arrived at the planet (which is related to the chemical composition of the atmosphere). The power emitted by the planet per area is related to the surface temperature and the absorption of the atmosphere. We looked up some graphs of absorption curves (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018327415) and estimated the absorption percentage at different frequencies for some common atmospheric chemicals.Then we combined them with the black-body radiation curve to obtain the planet\u0026rsquo;s surface temperature at which the power by the surface per area equals the power on the surface per area.\nA large part of Stupid Planets is its ability to generate completely procedural planets based on a variety of properties. Taking inspiration from real categories of exoplanets, several types of planets may appear in any given solar system. Earth-like planets appear in the habitable zone with usually habitable conditions while snowy and rocky worlds exist on the outer bounds of the system. Each terrain is generated through a layered Perlin noise based on the chemical composition, orbital radius, properties of the sun, etc.\n","permalink":"https://blog.ianmkim.com/posts/stupid_planets/","summary":"Developer Global Nominee for NASA\u0026rsquo;s Space Apps Challenge 2020.

This is different for people on the spectrum, but in general, autistic people have unusually sensitive \u0026ldquo;sensory\u0026rdquo; systems. This means that they can be easily overwhelmed by senses sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.\nIt is challenging for people with autism to simply ignore unwanted sensory information as it comes in. This usually leads to a meltdown. A meltdown is ‘an intense response to overwhelming situations’. It usually happens when someone becomes completely overwhelmed by their current situation and loses behavioral control temporarily. This loss of control can be expressed verbally (shouting, screaming, crying), physically (kicking, lashing out, biting) or in both ways.\nSolution Created at MIT Launch X 2019, Cognality VR provides a WebVR platform to mitigate the effects of meltdowns through sensory overloads.\nTechnology WebXR is a rapidly developing technology being backed by big names like Facebook\u0026rsquo;s Oculus and Mozilla. As most browsers start adopting WebXR standards, VR on phones are becoming more readily available. We use WebXR to display dynamic, fully 3D scenes which can be adjusted based on whatever criteria we choose.\nCurrently, our scenes are pre-made based on our preliminary survey. In the future, our goal is to have a fully customizable scene based on previous usage and user experience surveys.\nData Collection The key to achieving the goal of fully automated customizable scenes is data collection. The eventual goal is to create a metric which we can use to determine the effectiveness of certain elements whether it\u0026rsquo;d be colors or shapes and create a simple rule-based algorithm to arrange certain models.\n","permalink":"https://blog.ianmkim.com/posts/cognality_vr/","summary":"CTO \u0026amp; Co-founder Cognality is a web based virtual reality platform that helps autistic children mitigate the effects of meltdowns and overloads.
