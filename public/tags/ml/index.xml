      <description>Developer An API &amp;amp; facial recognition system for Woodberry&amp;rsquo;s student that automatically tags relevant individuals in the school photo album instead of manual student tagging.
Nobody likes manual labor This project originally started as a set piece for a production of George Orwell&amp;rsquo;s 1984 and quickly evolved into a face recognition system that automatically tagged various students in the school photo album.
Before such system, the school would take volunteer workers to manually sift through hundreds of images to tag people.</description>

      <description>CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder A web platform that uses SOTA NLP and ML techniques to help debaters compile evidence and write cases.
Motivation As avid debaters in Highschool, my partner and I were tired of seeing news and statistics misused, misquoted, and mistreated. Especially among the beginner population, the inability to correctly and fairly interpret evidence without commiting logical fallacies often derail the debate.
When my partner and I attended the 2018 Harvard Debate summer program, we realized that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a problem for poorly funded debate programs in the south but rather a problem all around the country.</description>
