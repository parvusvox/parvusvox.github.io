### CEO & Co-Founder

A web platform that uses SOTA NLP and ML techniques to help debaters compile evidence and write cases.

## Motivation
As avid debaters in Highschool, my partner and I were tired of seeing news and statistics misused, misquoted, and mistreated. Especially among the beginner population, the inability to correctly and fairly interpret evidence without commiting logical fallacies often derail the debate.

When my partner and I attended the 2018 Harvard Debate summer program, we realized that this wasn't just a problem for poorly funded debate programs in the south but rather a problem all around the country.

## Solution
While natural language processing is still an infant field, they could still be applied in a useful way to guide debaters during research.
  - "objectivity" rating
  - automated summarization based on BERT embedding clustering
  - entity based sentiment analysis

As well as some other useful but not necessarily NLP related tools like...
  - Quick search feature
  - Relavant article search using News API
  - Speed reader
  - Organized and sharable cut cards
