      <description>Developer Global Nominee for NASA&amp;rsquo;s Space Apps Challenge 2020. A colonization game that (semi) accurately simulates thermodynamic and physical properties of exo-planets and star systems.

Stupid planets aims to recreate a sandbox-like environment of procedural star systems and exoplanets. The aim of Stupid Planets is to provide an educational experience on the basic elements needed for life and colonization on exoplanets through scientific modelling, physically based orbital movement and loose modelling of chemical compositions and interactions.</description>
