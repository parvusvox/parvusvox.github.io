      <description>Developer Global Nominee for NASA&amp;rsquo;s Space Apps Challenge 2020. A colonization game that (semi) accurately simulates thermodynamic and physical properties of exo-planets and star systems.
https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/planets-near-and-far/build-planet-workshop/teams/quinn-the-buffalo/project
Stupid planets aims to recreate a sandbox-like environment of procedural star systems and exoplanets. The aim of Stupid Planets is to provide an educational experience on the basic elements needed for life and colonization on exoplanets through scientific modelling, physically based orbital movement and loose modelling of chemical compositions and interactions.</description>

      <description>Developer An API &amp;amp; facial recognition system for Woodberry&amp;rsquo;s student that automatically tags relevant individuals in the school photo album instead of manual student tagging.
Nobody likes manual labor This project originally started as a set piece for a production of George Orwell&amp;rsquo;s 1984 and quickly evolved into a face recognition system that automatically tagged various students in the school photo album.
Before such system, the school would take volunteer workers to manually sift through hundreds of images to tag people.</description>

      <description>Developer A computer vision system &amp;amp; web frontend that utilizes fast object detection algorithms on single-board computers and time series forecasting to predict &amp;amp; display wait times at the school grill
Motivation The Fir Tree is a school grill and is oftentimes very crowded and lines regularly reach the exit doors. To alleviate long lines and pressure from workers, I created Fir Tree Stats, a live-updating dashboard that tells you exactly how many people are waiting in the line currently, how long it will take for you to get your food, and how many people were inside the restaurant.</description>

      <description>CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder A web platform that uses SOTA NLP and ML techniques to help debaters compile evidence and write cases.
Motivation As avid debaters in Highschool, my partner and I were tired of seeing news and statistics misused, misquoted, and mistreated. Especially among the beginner population, the inability to correctly and fairly interpret evidence without commiting logical fallacies often derail the debate.
When my partner and I attended the 2018 Harvard Debate summer program, we realized that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a problem for poorly funded debate programs in the south but rather a problem all around the country.</description>

      <description>Co-Founder A privacy &amp;amp; anonymity centric forum for open discussion for Woodberry Forest School
Motivation Woodberry is a private all-boys boarding school in the south. In an environment like that, getting your voice heard can be a challenging task. You barely have to go through the first few paragraphs of Woodberry&amp;rsquo;s wikipedia entry to get the sense of strict hierarchical structures of the prefect system.
In such environments, the voices of marginalized identities, views, and opinions are oppressed and dismissed purely by association to the individual who authors them.</description>
