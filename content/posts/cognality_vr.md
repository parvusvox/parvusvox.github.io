### CTO & Co-founder

Cognality is a web based virtual reality platform that helps autistic children mitigate the effects of meltdowns and overloads. Cognality is currently collaborating with Dr. Boyd of Chapman University to conduct an academic study on product effectiveness.

## About the Issue
People with autism are usually highly sensitive to their environments. This is different for people on the spectrum, but in general, autistic people have unusually sensitive "sensory" systems. This means that they can be easily overwhelmed by senses sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.

It is challenging for people with autism to simply ignore unwanted sensory information as it comes in. This usually leads to a meltdown. A meltdown is ‘an intense response to overwhelming situations’. It usually happens when someone becomes completely overwhelmed by their current situation and loses behavioral control temporarily. This loss of control can be expressed verbally (shouting, screaming, crying), physically (kicking, lashing out, biting) or in both ways.

## Solution
Created at MIT Launch X 2019, Cognality VR provides a WebVR platform to mitigate the effects of meltdowns through sensory overloads.

## Technology
WebXR is a rapidly developing technology being backed by big names like Facebook's Oculus and Mozilla. As most browsers start adopting WebXR standards, VR on phones are becoming more readily available. We use WebXR to display dynamic, fully 3D scenes which can be adjusted based on whatever criteria we choose.

Currently, our scenes are pre-made based on our preliminary survey. In the future, our goal is to have a fully customizable scene based on previous usage and user experience surveys.

## Data Collection
The key to achieving the goal of fully automated customizable scenes is data collection. The eventual goal is to create a metric which we can use to determine the effectiveness of certain elements whether it'd be colors or shapes and create a simple rule-based algorithm to arrange certain models.
