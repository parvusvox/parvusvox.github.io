      <description>Developer An API &amp;amp; facial recognition system for Woodberry&amp;rsquo;s student that automatically tags relevant individuals in the school photo album instead of manual student tagging.
Nobody likes manual labor This project originally started as a set piece for a production of George Orwell&amp;rsquo;s 1984 and quickly evolved into a face recognition system that automatically tagged various students in the school photo album.
Before such system, the school would take volunteer workers to manually sift through hundreds of images to tag people.</description>
