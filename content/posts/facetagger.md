### Developer

An API & facial recognition system for Woodberry's student that automatically tags relevant individuals in the school photo album instead of manual student tagging.

## Nobody likes manual labor
This project originally started as a set piece for a production of George Orwell's 1984 and quickly evolved into a face recognition system that automatically tagged various students in the school photo album.

Before such system, the school would take volunteer workers to manually sift through hundreds of images to tag people. Instead, I collected this data to build a reliable database of every student's face encodings (or from the school portrait if the student is a freshman) to automatically recognize and tag faces and embed that information in the picture's metadata.
