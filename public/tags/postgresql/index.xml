      <description>CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder A web platform that uses SOTA NLP and ML techniques to help debaters compile evidence and write cases.
Motivation As avid debaters in Highschool, my partner and I were tired of seeing news and statistics misused, misquoted, and mistreated. Especially among the beginner population, the inability to correctly and fairly interpret evidence without commiting logical fallacies often derail the debate.
When my partner and I attended the 2018 Harvard Debate summer program, we realized that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a problem for poorly funded debate programs in the south but rather a problem all around the country.</description>

      <description>Co-Founder A privacy &amp;amp; anonymity centric forum for open discussion for Woodberry Forest School
Motivation Woodberry is a private all-boys boarding school in the south. In an environment like that, getting your voice heard can be a challenging task. You barely have to go through the first few paragraphs of Woodberry&amp;rsquo;s wikipedia entry to get the sense of strict hierarchical structures of the prefect system.
In such environments, the voices of marginalized identities, views, and opinions are oppressed and dismissed purely by association to the individual who authors them.</description>
